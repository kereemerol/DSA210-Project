Project Proposal

The movie industry represents the reflection of social, cultural and economical dynamics of the community across time. In this project of mine, I will aim to analyze how box office statistics changed over the years within enhancing film industry, and what factors (such as title, release year, genres, the total budget invested in the movie, IMDb ratings, the cast of the movie) influenced the overall success of movies.



Research Question

How the factors such as budget, cast of the movie, IMDb ratings and genre best determines the movie's box office overall success in terms of total revenue?
